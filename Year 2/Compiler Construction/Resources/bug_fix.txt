How to fix the read operation:

| READ ->
  cmd "popq %rdi" "BEGIN read, put arg in %rdi";
  cmd "movq $0,%rax" "signal no floating point args";
  cmd "pushq %r11" "%r11 is caller-saved ";
  cmd "movq %rsp, %r12" "save stack pointer temporarily";
  cmd "andq $-16, %rsp" "align stack to closest 16 bits";
  cmd "call read" "get user input";
  cmd "movq %r12 , %rsp" "restore stack pointer";
  cmd "popq %r11" "restore %r11";
  cmd "pushq %rax" "END read, a C-call, so result in %rax \n"

The three new instructions temporarily change the stack pointer to be 16 byte aligned before the read function is called and then put it back. I think the bug only occurs on 64-bit systems.
